        <p>Happiness is something everyone searches for, yet it often feels just out of reach. Is it hidden in wealth, fame, relationships, or personal achievements? Or is it found in the small, simple moments of everyday life? Let’s take a journey into discovering the real <b>secret to a happy life</b>.</p>

        <h2>Gratitude is the Foundation</h2>
        <p>It is easy to focus on what we lack instead of what we have. But when you take a moment each day to appreciate the little blessings—a warm cup of tea, the sound of rain, a smile from a friend—you start to feel a deeper joy. 
        Ask yourself:
        <ul>
            <li>What’s one thing I’m grateful for today?</li>
            <li>When was the last time I truly appreciated the people in my life?</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <img src="happy3.jpg" alt="Fresh life">

        <h2>Live in the Present</h2>
        <p>Many of us spend too much time worrying about the future or regretting the past. True happiness lies in experiencing the <em>now</em>. Take a deep breath, look around, and fully engage with the moment you are in.</p>

        <h2>Healthy Relationships Matter</h2>
        <p>Surround yourself with people who uplift you. Even science proves that strong relationships contribute to a longer, happier life. 
        Ask yourself:
        <ul>
            <li>Do I spend enough time with people who make me feel good?</li>
            <li>When was the last time I truly listened to someone without distractions?</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <img src="happy5.jpg" alt="Friends">

        <h2>Self-Care is Not Selfish</h2>
        <p>You can’t pour from an empty cup. Whether it’s reading a book, going for a walk, or enjoying a hobby—make time for yourself.</p>

        <h2>Purpose Brings Joy</h2>
        <p>Life feels more meaningful when you work toward something you care about. Whether it’s your career, a creative project, or helping others—find your “why.”</p>

        <p>Remember: happiness isn’t a final destination, it’s a daily choice.</p>

        <p> So, what’s one small thing you will do today to make your life a little happier?</p>
